## 🧐 What is this place?
Yo! I'm **Sarthak**, and this isn't your average boring corporate portfolio. It's a **living, breathing cartoon world** designed to showcase my skills as a **Creative Developer**.

I got tired of standard grids and safe colors. I wanted to build something that feels **fun**, **tactile**, and **alive**. Think bold borders, vibrant colors, and components that actually react when you poke them.

## �️ The Arsenal (My Skills)
I built this bad boy using the bleeding edge of web tech:

*   **⚡ Next.js 16**: Because speed is everything.
*   **🎨 Tailwind CSS v4**: Styling at the speed of thought.
*   **✨ Framer Motion**: Making things bounce, slide, and wiggle.
*   **🧩 TypeScript**: Keeping the chaos organized.

## 🌟 Cool Features to Check Out
*   **👀 Eye-Tracking Hero**: The cartoon version of me actually watches your cursor. Creepy? Maybe. Cool? Definitely.
*   **🖱️ Alive Props**: Every section has a 3D-ish cartoon prop (Mug, Gear, Calendar) that floats and reacts.
*   **🕹️ Gamified Experience**: My career isn't a list; it's a video game level map.
*   **📱 Mobile Optimized**: Looks just as good on your phone as it does on your 4K monitor.

## � Run It Yourself
Want to see how the sausage is made? Clone it and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy the show!
