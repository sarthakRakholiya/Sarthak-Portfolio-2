# Portfolio Website Walkthrough

I have successfully created a modern, high-performance portfolio website for you using Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion.

## Features Implemented
- **Cartoon/Neobrutalism Theme**: Bold black borders, hard shadows, and vibrant colors (Yellow, Blue, Pink).
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Fully supported with a toggle switch (Sun/Moon icon).
- **Hero Section**: Playful "Toon" style with a **"Monitor Face" character** (eye tracking, blinking) and animated background scene (Sun, Clouds).
- **About Section**: **"Character Profile" layout** with a trading card (Stats, Class, Level) and a comic-book style bio.
- **Skills Section**: **Interactive Sticker Board** where skills are draggable "stickers" on a desk surface.
- **Experience Section**: **Gamified "Level Map"** layout (Super Mario style) connecting your career milestones.
- **Projects Section**: **"Comic Book Gallery"** layout where each project is an "Issue" with cover art and plot details.
- **Contact Section**: **"Retro Arcade"** theme with "Game Over / Continue?" headline and big arcade-style social buttons.
- **Section Dividers**: **"Torn Paper"** style dividers with jagged edges that blend seamlessly between sections.
